Some more Sonic Pi pieces, including most of Michael Jackson's Thriller.

#Playing Thriller

To play most Sonic Pi files, a user typically has to add code directly into the program's code editor. I found that, once my arrangement of Thriller got beyond a certain number of lines of code, it would no longer play consistently (it tended to fail halfway through the song).

To remedy this, I placed the code into the THRILLER.rb file; then in Sonic Pi, I run the code from thrillerfile.txt (You will need to edit the directory to accurately reflect your file system).
